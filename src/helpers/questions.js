	"Where does your character come from? This can be specific to the setting (The Davis Farmstead on Boros) or generic (a small farming town in the hills). But in either case, where are your character's roots, and what does your character think about the place they grew up in?",
	"Who is your character's family? Did your character grow up with a lot of siblings, or were they an only child? If se, who were they? If not, who raised your character? Is your character still on good terms with their family, or not?",
	"What is your character's social standing? Is your character a respected member of their community and culture? Or are they simply one of the unremarkable masses? Or maybe they an outcast, shunned by the members of \"decent\" society? What did your character do before they became a sky sailor?",
	"How old is your character? Are they young and brash, or old and wise? (Or maybe old and brash, or young and wise) If they're middle-aged or older, how have they changed as they aged? ",
	"What does your character think about the world? Your answer could be very general (a cynical attitude toward everyone they meet), or specific to the setting (they hate the unjust rule of the Allied Islands Trading Union). You could even ask and answer this question multiple times, picking a different aspect of the setting each time.",
	"Why did your character leave home? Likely, your character is now a sky sailor and has left part or all of their old life behind them. Why? What happened?",

	"What secret does only the crew know about your character?",
	"What secret does no one know about your character?",
	"One of these should be world bending or exploiting, or some other form of exception. This shouldn't give you a mechanical advantage, and should be something that would make sense to visit narratively from time to time, and should eventually have some sort of resolution that the GM can leverage.",
	"Coordinate this carefully with your GM and don't push too hard on the world bending since the GM may know things about the world that you don't yet and you don't want to spoil that. At the same time, the GM may use your secret to shape the world in some way that you may or may not be aware of.",
